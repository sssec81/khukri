## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (`rustup`)
- WSL2 or Linux / macOS for development

### Build

```bash
cargo build -p khukri-engine
```

### Test

Runs 17 unit tests + 6 integration tests (local HTTP server, no network required):

```bash
cargo test -p khukri-engine
```

### CLI smoke-test

```bash
# Streaming download (no Content-Length)
cargo run --example download -- "https://speed.cloudflare.com/__down?bytes=10485760" /tmp/test.bin

# Segmented download (parallel, with range support)
cargo run --example download -- https://proof.ovh.net/files/10Mb.dat /tmp/test.bin

# With speed cap (500 KB/s)
cargo run --example download -- https://proof.ovh.net/files/10Mb.dat /tmp/test.bin 512000
```

## Sprint 1 — The Steel

### What's implemented

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `engine/segment.rs` | Thread count formula: `clamp(floor(file_size_MB / 50), 4, 64)` |
| `engine/download.rs` | Segmented parallel download + streaming fallback (no Content-Length), deterministic download IDs, cancellation-aware entrypoint |
| `engine/download.rs` (API) | Public `spawn_download` + `DownloadHandle` progress watcher (`watch`) for bytes/speed/ETA/status |
| `engine/retry.rs` | Exponential back-off with ±10% jitter; permanent errors (403, 404) never retried |
| `engine/prealloc.rs` | `fallocate` (Linux) / `SetEndOfFile` (Windows) / `ftruncate` (macOS) before writes |
| `engine/throttle.rs` | Token-bucket rate limiter; shared across segment tasks for accurate per-download cap |
| `engine/queue.rs` | Priority queue (High / Normal / Low); `max_concurrent` hot-configurable at runtime |
| `db/mod.rs` | SQLite persistence for download + segment state; transactional segment insert + idempotent upsert/reset helpers |
| `config.rs` | Input validation for URL/path/thread override bounds before execution |

### Test coverage

| Type | Count | What |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | 17 | Thread count formula (including tiny/zero-byte edge cases), retry logic (2 failures → success, permanent error, abort, exhaustion), token bucket (no-sleep, deficit sleep, unlimited), priority ordering, config validation |
| Integration | 6 | SHA-256 verified segmented download, streaming fallback, retry on transient 5xx, permanent 403 not retried, resume only re-fetches incomplete segments, spawned progress reporting |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Thread count:** `clamp(floor(file_size_MB / 50), 4, 64)` — one thread per 50 MB, bounded 4–64
- **TLS:** rustls (pure Rust — no system OpenSSL dependency)
- **Segment writes:** each task opens the file independently and seeks to its byte offset — no mutex on the file, no overlapping ranges
- **Pause/resume:** deterministic download ID (URL + output path) with SQLite segment state; only incomplete segments are fetched on resume
- **Throttling:** token bucket shared across all segment tasks; sliced to ≤ 1s of burst to handle large chunks correctly
- **Pre-allocation:** reserves full disk space before any segment writes — prevents fragmentation and catches out-of-space early
- **Queue slot safety:** RAII drop guard ensures `active_count` is always decremented even if a download task panics
- **Cancellation:** cooperative cancellation support via `start_download_with_cancel(..., CancellationToken)` updates state to `paused`
- **Progress API:** `spawn_download` returns `DownloadHandle` with a `watch` subscription for status, bytes done, speed, ETA, and segment counts
- **Config safety:** invalid runtime config (empty URL/path, invalid thread override) is rejected early with explicit errors

## Notes

- `Cargo.lock` is excluded from git (correct for a library crate). When the Tauri binary is added in Sprint 3, `Cargo.lock` will be committed since application binaries should lock their dependencies.
- Integration risk register and mitigation checklist are documented in [docs/integration-hardening.md](docs/integration-hardening.md).
